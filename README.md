# Hi there 👋 I'm Theo, a penultimate year MSci Natural Scientist


### I am studying to become a Master of Science at Durham University, graduating in summer 2027.
> MSci Natural Sciences: Computer Science and Mathematics - Year 3 of 4.

### I am currently working on Reaction-Diffusion simulation on arbitrary geometries.

# My University Degree 🎓 - Ongoing!

I study Mathematics & Computer Science at Durham University under the Natural Sciences program. 
> A Natural Sciences degree allows you to persue whichever modules you choose, from whichever departments you choose, therby allowing for much greater academic freedom than a 'regular' degree.
> It is a 'choose-your-own-adventure'-style degree, letting you build a multidisciplinary base of knowledge across your academic curiosities! Each year I have taken a roughly
> equal split of symbiotic maths and compsci modules that now allows me to persue a more mathematically complex Master's level Dissertation/Project using skills from both subjects.

I am due to graduate as a Master of Science in June 2027.
> Additionally, according to the measure employed by Durham University, a Natural Sciences student is the most qualified of any student. ✨
