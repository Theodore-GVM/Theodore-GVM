# Hi there 👋 I'm Theo, a penultimate year MSci Natural Scientist

### I am studying to become a Master of Science at Durham University, graduating in summer 2027.
> MSci Natural Sciences: Computer Science and Mathematics - Year 3 of 4.

### I am currently working on Reaction-Diffusion simulation on arbitrary geometries.

# My Technologies 💻


# My University Degree 🎓 - Ongoing!

I study Mathematics & Computer Science at Durham University under the Natural Sciences program. 
> A Natural Sciences degree allows you to persue whichever modules you choose, from whichever departments you choose, therby allowing for much greater academic freedom than a 'regular' degree.
> It is a 'choose-your-own-adventure'-style degree, letting you build a multidisciplinary base of knowledge across your academic curiosities! Each year I have taken a roughly
> equal split of symbiotic maths and compsci modules that now allows me to persue a more mathematically complex Master's level Dissertation/Project using skills from both subjects.

I am due to graduate as a Master of Science in June 2027.
> Additionally, according to the measure employed by Durham University, a Natural Sciences student is the most qualified of any student. ✨

## 4th Year
While I am still a 3rd year student, I will outline the modules I intend to take in my final year.
### Computer Science: (80 credits)
* Advanced Project (60 credits)
  > This is my Master's level project on Reaction-Diffusion on heterogeneous media, including growing domains.
* Adavanced Parallel Scientific Computing (10 credits)
  > Having thoroughly enjoyed the 3rd year Parallel Scientific Computing module, I intent to take its advanced successor to extend my skills in numerical algorithms, HPC and GPU computing
* Advanced Computer Graphics & Visualisation (10 credits)
  > I want more examined practical experience in this area - I am excited to explore the coursework in OpenGL.
### Mathematics: (40 credits)
> This will likely be a combination of applied statistics modules (Uncertainty Quantification, High-Dimensional Statistics, Nonparametric Statistics, Advanced Topics in Statistics) and Advanced Mathematical Biology.

## 3rd Year
### Computer Science: (60 credits)
* Parallel Scientific Computing (20 credits)
  > * HPC benchmarking for Durham University's _Hamilton_ HPC facilty.
  > * Multi-core N-Body Simulation -- parallelised over 128 cores using OpenMP
